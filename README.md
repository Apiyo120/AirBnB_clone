# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Description

Welcome to the AirBnB Clone project! This project aims to create a simplified version of the AirBnB platform where users can manage various objects using a command-line interface. This project is divided into several phases, each building upon the previous one to eventually create a functional AirBnB-like application.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a crucial component of this project. It allows users to interact with the project's objects through a command-line interface. Here's how you can use it:

### How to Start the Command Interpreter

To start the command interpreter, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./console.py

### How to Use the Command Interpreter

Once the command interpreter is running, you'll see the prompt (hbnb). Here, you can enter various commands to interact with the project's objects. Use the help command to see a list of available commands and their descriptions.

Examples
Here are a few examples of how you can use the command interpreter:

### Creating a new user:

(hbnb) create User

###Listing all available objects:

(hbnb) all

### Updating an object's attributes:

(hbnb) update User 12345 first_name "John"
